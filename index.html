        <p> My name is Jonathan Fuentes. I've been coding since June of 2018. Every since I've started I've dedicated countless hours to mastering my craft. I never stop learning. Some of the sources I've used to retain my knowledge of coding include but are not limited to: CodeAcedmy, TeamTreeHouse, FreeCodeCamp, Udemy, and YouTube.</p>
